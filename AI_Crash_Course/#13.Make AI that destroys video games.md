STEP1:Build game

Build the game and set up everything like rules and graphics.

STEP2:Create AI

Think about how to create a AI model that can play the game and learn to get better.

STEP3:Train model

Train the model and evaluate how well it works.

STEP1 (Pretent there are imagines)

STEP2 like human evolution

Mutation affects how much the AI changes overall.

Balance steadily improving each generation with making big changes that might be really helpful ( or harmful ).

Mutation+original

1.participate

2.evaluate

3.clone

4.mutate

Genetic algorithms tend to work pretty well on small problems, but when the problems get bigger, the random mutations of genetic algorithms are sometimes too random to create consistently good results.
