How does Google find answers to question?

Search engines are just AI systems that are getting better and better at helping us find what we’re looking for.

Search engines gather data, create organization systems to sort that data, and find results to a question.

Sometimes we ask our smart devices questions and we want actual answers……not links to Web pages.

Knowledge base encodes information about the relationships between A and B. 

One of the main problems with knowledge bases is that it’s really hard to write down all of the facts in the universe, especially common sense things that humans take for granted, but computers need to be told.

A huge knowledge base called the Never Ending Language Learner or NELL, which was able to extract hundreds of thousands of facts from random Web pages.
