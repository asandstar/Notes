Human-AI teams can use our strengths to help each other, and collaborate to fill in each other’s weakness.

Make betterdiagnoses, brainstorm new inventions, or imagine a future where humans and robots are working side-by-side.

AI and humans have skills that can complement each other.

AI can be good at searching through lots of possibilities and making some intelligent guesses at which one to pick.

Humans can be good at insight, creativity, and understanding the nuances of language and behavior.

We’ve learned from living in the world and interacting with each other, so we’re better than AI systems at interpreting social signals.

AI can amplify our decision-making activities with the right information.

You could’ve supported an AI without even realizing it.

Providing personal data: DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD

Get into the Algorithmic Bias episode.

By understanding how AI works, what it’s good at, and where it struggles, we can also find opportunities to work more effectively and to create new types of jobs that involve collaboration.

Human-AI collaboration can help us narrow down complex decision trees and make better choices.

Human-Robot collaboration has the potential to give us super strength or resilience.
