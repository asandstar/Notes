KNOWLEDGE BASE: the collection of all true things about our universe 

We can use logic to carefully examine our knowledge bases in order to answer questions and discover new things with AI.

IMPLICATION命题: connects two different propositions

IF/THEN STATEMENTS:IF hungry THEN eat snacks.

INFERENCE推理: The process of coming up with new propositions and checking whether they fit with the logic of a knowledge base.

EXPERT SYSTEMS: ( replace an expert like an insurance agent or a loan officer) Help make decisions.

A symbolic AI can show a doctor why it chose one diagnosis over another or explain why an auto loan was denied. 

“GOOD OLD-FASHIONED AI”helpful in situations where the rules are obvious and can be explicitly entered as symbols into a knowledge base.
